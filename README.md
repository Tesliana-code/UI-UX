# UI-UX
UI for developers

## Design & Dev

Our next focus is to translate the technical vision into concrete UI/UX designs and robust development practices.

### Figma Wireframes & Prototypes

Use Figma to create wireframes and interactive prototypes for the following key pages:

- **Homepage**  
  Includes the main search bar powered by vector search, featured products carousel, and category highlights.

- **Search Results Page**  
  Displays products ranked by semantic relevance using the vector search engine. Include filters, sorting options, and pagination.

- **Product Detail Pages**  
  Detailed product information, images, reviews, and related products section.

- **User Profile and Checkout Flows**  
  User account management, order history, and multi-step checkout process with payment integration.

### Frontend-Backend Integration Patterns

Document clear API contracts and data flows between the Rust backend services and the frontend React components, focusing on:

- Search API handling vector embeddings queries  
- Product catalog CRUD operations  
- User authentication and session management  
- Cart and order processing endpoints

Include these docs inside the `docs/integration/` folder for team reference.

### Development Setup (`dev-setup.md`)

Create and maintain a `dev-setup.md` file with instructions for:

- Environment preparation (WSL setup, Rust toolchain installation, VS Code setup)  
- Figma account creation and workspace organization  
- Git workflow for collaboration  
- Running local servers and testing integration points
